Name : Manish Kumar

List of Experiments:
1.	WAP to implement the Perceptron Learning Algorithm using numpy in Python. Evaluate performance of a single perceptron for NAND and XOR truth tables as input dataset.
2.	WAP to implement a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network with one hidden layer using numpy in Python. Demonstrate that it can learn the XOR Boolean function.  
3.	WAP to implement a three-layer neural network using Tensor flow library (only, no keras) to classify MNIST handwritten digits dataset. Demonstrate the implementation of feed-forward and back-propagation approaches. 
4.	WAP to evaluate the performance of implemented three-layer neural network with variations in activation functions, size of hidden layer, learning rate, batch size and number of epochs. 
5.	WAP to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network using Keras Library to classify MNIST fashion dataset. Demonstrate the effect of filter size, regularization, batch size and optimization algorithm on model performance. 
6.	WAP to train and evaluate a Recurrent Neural Network using PyTorch Library to predict the next value in a sample time series dataset. 
7.	WAP to retrain a pretrained imagenet model to classify a medical image dataset. 
Mini Project 1: Build an image dataset that contains grayscale images of leaves of various plants/trees growing in MBMU campus. Perform necessary preprocessing steps to make the dataset uniform and ready for training. Train a deep autoencoder network that can reproduce any random image of a leaf from MBMU campus. 
Bonus: Can we use this network to identify if a leaf is from MBM Campus or not?
Mini Project 2: Create an Android App that captures the readings from motion sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) in an android phone. Build a dataset using this application that contains the motion characteristics of an average person driving a two-wheeler. Build a LSTM classifier that takes any 3 second sample as input and classifies it as Kankar Road, Bitumen Road, Concrete Road, Single Speed Breaker and Multiple Speed Breakers. 
Bonus: Can we use this dataset to generate alerts when a person is rash driving?
Mini Project 3: Build a Video Dataset that contains short videos (max. 5 seconds) of students performing Yogasanas (atleast 6 asanas) with diverse backgrounds, ambient lighting and clothes. Train a CNN that can identify the asana being performed in the video. 
Bonus: Can we further rate the asana pose as Good, Average and Poor?
